Space is a places full of wonders, and looking up to see them is a dream to me. When I was a small child, I would read books that teach me about the stars up there and rockets help us to see them. And I know that this is my passion and the thing I will do in the future.Although I find great joy about almosy everything related to space exploration, spacecrafts like rockts and satellites are my favourite, since they are useful tools for us to reach the sky. And after some hard study, I finally get in space related field and could do some work.

I'm currently a master student of Center for Composite Metrials and Structures(CCMS),Harbin Institute of Technology. My research now focuses on design,optimization of "composite liquid rocket engine frame" and "service module frame"(for space capsule).
